<h2>Downloading code snapshots</h2>
<p>You can download all the content of a master branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either clone the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

Important: You always download the entire branch content!
</p>

<h2>Running the attached code</h2>

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).

Then Run npm start to start the server.
